Description: Generates passwords that you can recover using a master password. It takes advantage of the fact that random 
    numbers generated by computers are not actually random and you can duplicate exactly a sequence from a random number
    generator by setting the seed to the same value each time. You can use this to develop a master password which then
    becomes the seed.
    This is not really very secure and depends more on obscurity than anything else. It is also relatively featureless.
    Kind of fun though and it does highlight the fact that random numbers on a computer are not really random.
