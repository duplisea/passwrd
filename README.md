# passwrd
Multiple password generator in R.

This is not secure in the sense of encryption secure and it has lots of limitations. In fact there is nothing encrypted. It just generates a long random number sequence based on how you start it out. If you always start it the same way, it will always generate the same sequence.

Because random sequences generated by a computer are not actually random and can be perfectly duplicated by setting the seed to the same value each time, you can re-generate a password by using a master password to set the seed. So essentially this code generates a big vector of different characters and then parses it up into  passwords. The vector can be duplicated over and over by making the seed the master password.

You need to have R installed on your computer to use it. Rstudio is a good ide but it is not necessary to install it for this package.
